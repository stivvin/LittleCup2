CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE

This was inspired by GreenAndACat's Little Cup Red hack.

Changes:

- All pokemon are reduced to level 5
- All pokemon (outside of a few select boss pokemon) are unevolved species
that have the potential to evolve in the vanilla Red and Blue
- However, all of these species can be caught by the player. There are no
version exclusives.
- The unique boss pokemon include those that do not evolve in Red and Blue
but do in later games, such as Onix and Tangela
- Pokemon cannot gain experience or stat experience in battle
- The daycare man will be removed
- Rare candies, vitamins, and evolutionary stones are unusable
(most outside of Mount Moon will be removed from the game)
- Medicine cannot be used in battle and battle items are unusable
- Set mode is effectively always on
- Badge boosts are removed
- Enemy pokemon no longer have an additional 25% chance to fail stat-reducing
moves
- Running away from wild pokemon is much more difficult. The first attempt
will always fail, and outspeeding the enemy does not guarantee a successful
attempt. The runaway formula is otherwise unchanged.
- Repels do now work on equal-leveled pokemon, but last for half as long.
Use them sparingly when possible, as you have much less available money.
- Nuggets will sell for less
- Trainer AI is somewhat improved, removing some infamous exploitable stuff.
- Many boss trainers will have fully customized movesets and full teams,
including all gym leaders other than Brock and Misty
- Some areas will be programmed to force you to do multiple fights in a row
without leaving. For example, all trainers on Nugget Bridge will reset if you
leave before beating them all.
